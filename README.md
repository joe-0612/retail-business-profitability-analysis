ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Highlights

- KPIs: Sales, Profit, Quantity
- Filters: Region, Product Type (Sub-Category), Season
- Slow-Mover Detection: Products flagged using inventory turnover
- Trend Charts: Seasonal patterns and profitability visuals
- Correlation Plot: Inventory Days vs Profit Margin

ðŸ“Š Correlation Insight (Python)

- Correlation between Inventory Days and Profit Margin: -0.25
  A weak negative correlation was observed â€” longer inventory holding slightly reduces profitability.

âœ… Key Findings

- Certain sub-categories (e.g., Tables, Binders) have high sales but poor profit margins
- Inventory Turnover reveals overstocked and slow-moving items
- Q4 shows highest seasonal demand, especially for Consumer segment
- Shipping delays increase Inventory Days and reduce profitability

ðŸ“Œ Recommendations

- Reduce stock for slow movers and low-margin categories
- Improve shipping speed to reduce Inventory Days
- Run seasonal promotions to optimize sales cycles
- Focus on high-margin, fast-turnover products
